# staging-server-checklist
A collection of staging server best practices and tips

## Motivation

Today I send **4.2 million** of emails to 20.000 users in our db. Thanksfully I got a quick response of sendgrid support and they stopped most of them very quickly before sending.

This would never happened with an strong staging environment, So I want to add this as public before this happen to any of you
